# rxjs-getting-started
Getting started and setting up RxJS

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Running

Run `npm start` to start the Webpack development server. Then point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`. This will require a browser that supports a certain level of ES2015 including the `fetch` API. Check [Can I use fetch](http://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch) to make sure you have a supported browser.

As an aside, you can also check the [ECMAScript 6 Compatibility chart](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) to determine how much of the ES2015 standard your current browser supports. 

## Branches

* `simple-observer` - First encounter with Observable and observers.
* `circle-demo` - Using the `mousemove` event to make a circle follow the mouse cursor.
