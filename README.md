Getting started and setting up RxJS

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Running

Run `npm start` to start the Webpack development server. Then point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`. This will require a browser that has a certain level of ES6 support including the `fetch` API. Check [Can I use fetch](http://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch) to make sure you have a supported browser.

As an aside, you can also check the [ECMAScript 6 Compatibility chart](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) to determine how much of the ES6 standard your current browser supports. For a browser with good ES6 support, check out [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/).

## Branches
